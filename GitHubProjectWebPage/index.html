                        <b>Difficult to listen to content.</b> With other apps it can be difficult to use sites like YouTube to listen to content. It can be time consuming to import
                        the YouTube video into your chosen app and even if you do their support for getting translations at the speed at which you need them whilst whatching the video can be poor. 
                        This can put many people off listening and that will untamatly hurt their langauge learning goals in the long term.

                        <b>Difficulty intergrating language learning into daily habbits.</b> Most apps used to help people learn languages require one to import content into the app. This takes 
                        time and can begin to feel like a chore. Wouldn't it be great if there was a tool that worked directly in the browser, no importing content? One could surf the web and engage
                        in a much wider range of contet.

                Being a chrome extension means it is right there in the browser, where the majority of content people are engaging with is going to be. Being able to get a translation for a 
                word will only ever be 3 or so clicks away.

                Lingo Journey makes watching YouTube realy easy and realy productive. In just a press of a button you will then be able to click on the subtitle and get translations.

                <h3>Visual depiction of progress</h3>
                Words which have never been seen before, words which have been seen but are not known and known words are all highligted different colours. This is very important because
                it gives a very visual dipiction of how much progress one has made in the language.
