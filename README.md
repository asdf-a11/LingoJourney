Wordify converts all the text (apart from urls ect) on screen to buttons which can be clicked.

Lingo Journey comes with a incomplete translation list to help you decide if Lingo Journey is the tool for you. If you find Lingo Journey usefull then I strongly suggesting getting the complete translations from the Lingo Journey patreon (TODO).
